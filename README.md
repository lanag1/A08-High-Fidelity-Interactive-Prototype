# A08: High Fidelity Interactive Prototype
*by Lana Garrett// DH110// Fall 2021*
## Overview
### Purpose
> The purpose of creating a high-fidelity prototype for this assignment is to visualize the functional and UX/UI design of my NY COVID appointment app. By making this prototype on Figma, I can easily make changes to the UI/UX design while walking through the interactive prototype.
### Process
> This high-fidelity, interactive prototype was created based on several steps throughout the design process. First, the interactions included in this prototype were chosen based on observations made during usability testing and contextual analysis. Next, I created 2 user personas that fit my ideal app user. Then, I hand-drew wireframes and wireflows as part of a low-fidelity prototype. I then tested this with a user as well. Feedback from both users helped me to design a more ready-to-use app. I incorporated these changes and feedback into my interactive, high-fidelity prototype. This prototype reflects my user's feedback as well personal creative changes made throughout the design process.
## Tasks
### Task 1:
> The first task on our New York COVID-19 vaccinaiton appointment app is to create an appointment. This is the primary function of the app. By making your appoointment via the mobile app, the population will have more free time at their disposal.
### Task 2:
> The second task on the New York COVID-19 vaccinaiton appointment app is to use the calendar funcition. In this section of the app, the user can look at their appointment they've made, the detials of their appointments, and the option to cancel their appointment.
## Wireframes
> My two tasks are quite intertwined so I created one wireframe for the two tasks. This is because the two tasks are so closely related that they often lead to one another (Ex: looking at your past vaccination in calendar might prompt you to create a new appointment for a second dose). Below is this wireframe.
